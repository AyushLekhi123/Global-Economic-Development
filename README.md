## 🔎 Overview  
This project analyzes **global economic and human development trends** from **1960 to 2018**, exploring the relationship between:  
- 💰 **GDP growth**  
- 👥 **Population expansion**  
- 📊 **Human Development Index (HDI)**  
- ⚡ **Electricity consumption**  
- 🏥 **Life expectancy**  

The analysis uses **data storytelling and visualization** to highlight regional differences, development gaps, and key factors driving prosperity.

## 📂 Data Source  
- Dataset provided by **[Maven Analytics](https://www.mavenanalytics.io/data-playground)** (curated for learning purposes).  
- Based on **World Bank** and **UNDP** indicators.  
- Timeframe: **1960–2018**  
- Key metrics include:  
  - GDP (current USD)  
  - Population  
  - HDI (2014 reference)  
  - Electricity consumption (kWh per capita)  
  - Life expectancy at birth (years)  

⚠️ *Note: The dataset is not uploaded here directly due to licensing restrictions. You can access it via Maven Analytics’ Data Playground.*

## 📈 Analysis & Visuals  

### 1. GDP Growth vs Population Growth  
- World GDP grew **8x faster** than population between 1960–2018.  
- Economic power shifted from **North America & Europe** → **East Asia & Pacific**.  

### 2. Life Expectancy vs GDP (Bubble Plot)  
- Positive correlation: richer countries → longer life spans.  
- Diminishing returns at higher GDP levels.  

### 3. HDI by Region (Bar Chart)  
- Huge inequality: **North America & Europe ~0.9+** vs **Sub-Saharan Africa ~0.5**.  

### 4. Electricity Consumption vs GDP  
- Strong correlation: higher electricity use → higher GDP per capita.  
- Energy access is a foundation for prosperity.  

### 5. GDP vs HDI  
- **Moderately strong correlation (r = 0.65)**.  
- GDP explains ~42% of HDI variation — the rest depends on governance, equality, healthcare, and education.

## 💡 Key Insights  
1. Global GDP growth has far outpaced population growth → productivity gains.  
2. Development progress is **unequal across regions**.  
3. GDP and HDI are linked, but **money alone is not enough** — social investment is key.  
4. **Electricity access** is a critical enabler of both growth and development.

## ✅ Recommendations  
- 🌍 **Developing regions (South Asia, Sub-Saharan Africa):** invest in education, healthcare, and electricity access.  
- 🌐 **Middle-income countries:** break the middle-income trap via innovation & inclusive growth.  
- 💡 **High-income countries:** address aging populations, lead in clean energy, and support global development.
